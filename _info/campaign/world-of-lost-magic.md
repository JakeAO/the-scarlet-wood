## Overview

In the world of The Scarlet Wood, magic was once a prevalent and powerful force that shaped the lives of all beings. However, over time, the relentless expansion of human civilization and its insatiable thirst for progress led to the gradual depletion of magical energies. As cities grew and technology advanced, the natural world was pushed aside, and with it, the ancient magic that once thrived.

Now, magic is a rare and fading phenomenon, with only a few pockets of it remaining in secluded and untouched areas like The Scarlet Wood. The creatures that inhabit these areas are among the last to retain a connection to this lost magic, making them unique and alien to the outside world. Creatures of The Wood are able to communicate with one another in a shared tongue, wield tools and magical abilities, and exhibit behaviors that are far more complex than their counterparts in the human-dominated world.

The loss of magic throughout the world has also manifested as a glamour that obscures the true nature of The Scarlet Wood from human eyes. To most humans, The Wood appears as an ordinary forest, devoid of any magical qualities. The creatures of The Wood appear as mundane animals, their true nature hidden by the illusion. This illusion serves to somewhat protect the creatures within from human interference, allowing them to live and thrive in relative safety.
