## Overview

The Scarlet Wood is filled with all manner of creatures, from the smallest insects to the largest predators. The magic suffusing The Wood and its inhabitants allows for the denizens to exhibit extraordinary traits and abilities, most important among them being the ability to communicate and collaborate with one another. This communication and collaboration, along with higher intelligence and reasoning skills, allow the denizens of The Scarlet Wood to form complex societies and cultures, making them more than just simple animals.

This advanced collaboration has led to the formation of multiple factions within The Scarlet Wood, each with its own unique roles and culture. These factions include:
- [The Moss-Fur Clan]({{ "/world/factions/moss-fur-clan" | relative_url }}): The largest faction by population, primarily made up of the working class of The Scarlet Wood. They are known for their industrious nature and strong sense of community.
- [The Earth-Movers]({{ "/world/factions/earth-movers" | relative_url }}): The faction of builders and architects, responsible for constructing the intricate earthworks, tunnels, burrows, and dams that make up much of The Wood's infrastructure.
- [The Scrapsmiths]({{ "/world/factions/scrapsmiths" | relative_url }}): The faction of scavengers and tinkerers who collect discarded items from the outside world and repurpose them into useful tools, weapons, and other items.
- [The Sky-Sailors]({{ "/world/factions/sky-sailors" | relative_url }}): The faction of airborne creatures and those adept at navigating the treetops. Responsible for scouting The Wood and serving as messengers between factions.
- [The Deep-Root Kin]({{ "/world/factions/deep-root-kin" | relative_url }}): The faction of 'others' within The Wood, those who share biologically little with the common denizens of The Wood, but are still an integral part of both the ecosystem and society.
