## Overview

The world of The Scarlet Wood is filled much like our own, with a diverse array of creatures and beings. From the smallest insects to the largest beasts, each plays a role in the ecosystem and culture of the world. Much like our own world, humankind is the dominant species and has driven many others to the brink of extinction through their aggressive expansion and exploitation of natural resources.

The creatures that inhabit The Scarlet Wood are imbued with the latent magical energy of The Wood itself, an energy all but drained from the rest of the world by humankind's relentless pursuit of progress. This magical energy allows inhabitants of The Wood to exceed the natural capabilities of their cousins in the outside world, leading to the emergence of unique traits and abilities found only in The Scarlet Wood.
