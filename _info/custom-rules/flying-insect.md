## Overview

Flying insects are defined by mobility, sensory awareness, and rapid-cycle stamina use, rather than toughness or strength. Some fly silently, some hover with precision, some dive-strike like living arrows. Unlike Crawling Insect, this species includes natural flight by default, and trades durability for speed and agility.
