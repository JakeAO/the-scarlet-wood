## Overview

Large mammals are powerful, durable, and physically imposing creatures. They excel in direct confrontation, endurance, and physical force, often dominating territory through strength rather than subtlety. While not always fast or nimble, they are difficult to kill, difficult to move, and often capable of delivering devastating physical attacks.
