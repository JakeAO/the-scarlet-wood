## Overview

Reptiles and amphibians in Utopia are cold-blooded, adaptable survivors defined by physiology over force. Some are patient ambushers, some rely on venom or constriction, others endure harsh climates through metabolic efficiency. They are not naturally social, but excel in instinct, environmental adaptation, and biological resilience.
