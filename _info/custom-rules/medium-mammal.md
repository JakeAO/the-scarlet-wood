## Overview

Medium mammals represent the broadest and most adaptable group in the forest ecosystem. They are neither as physically overwhelming as large mammals nor as evasive and fragile as small mammals. Instead, they specialize in versatility — able to shift between scouting, combat, problem-solving, tool use, and environmental interaction depending on need.
