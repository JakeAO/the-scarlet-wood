## Overview

This campaign is set in a world not unlike our own. A modern fantasy setting where magic is all but dead, where the unchecked pursuit of wealth and power has led to irreparable environmental damage, and where ancient secrets are being lost to time.

The Scarlet Wood is a vast, mysterious forest filled with myriad creatures that still possess a glimmer of the magic of the old world--a magic now all too uncommon in a world filled with manfolk and machines. The creatures of The Scarlet Wood work in unison to protect their home and survive in the face of encroaching civilization, setting aside petty squabbles to the benefit of survival.
